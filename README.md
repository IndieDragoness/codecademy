# PHP in HTML
You can embed PHP scripts into HTML documents with the opening tag `<?php` and closing tag `?>`. Use the `.php` extension instead of the `.html` extension.

## GET
In HTML, setting a form’s `method` attribute to `"get"` specifies that you would like the form to be submitted using the GET method.
When using this method, the form entries are passed as parameters in a URL query string.

## POST
In HTML, setting a form’s `method` attribute to `"post"` specifies that you would like the form to be submitted using the POST method.
When using POST to submit forms, you will not see the URL change. The form data is sent using the headers of the HTTP request instead of URL parameters.

# Definitions
1. Front-end: The portion of the website that is sent to the user/users browser. The 'Store front'. The front-end of a website consists of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and other static assets sent to the client.
2. Client: When we navigate to a website the browser is the client, and it sends a request to the back-end for all the assets needed to view and interact with the website.
3. Back-end: The portion of the website that supports operations requested by the front-end. The back-end consists of a web server and all the logic and data needed to create and maintain a website or web application.
4. Web Server (Back-end): a web server is a computer or program which listens for requests from clients and sends back responses. This component is well suited to handling delivery of static content.
5. Application Server (Back-end): this is actually often a collection of programming logic which is needed to deliver dynamic content to a client. The application server will often handle other tasks such as site security and interacting with data.
6. Data Base (Back-end): important information like usernames and passwords has to be stored and accessed somewhere. A large web application will often have multiple databases to store all different types of data needed to run the site smoothly.
7. PHP (Back-end): PHP is a back-end language. PHP can be used to generate HTML files. We embed PHP scripts within HTML by inserting PHP code between the opening (`<?php`) and closing (`?>`) tags. Presenting and interacting with HTML is one of the primary uses of PHP.
